# Professional-Portfolio

## Description 
This website shows off my best work while in the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp.


## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use see my professional portfolio.  

## Usage
The usage was to upload our class project and homework to our portfolio and add other professional platforms to our portfolio. 

## Credit
I  created this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I used Boot Strap for my css template and pulled code from my old homework and in class activities. 

## Contributing 
I put this project together with the help from my professor and TAs. I also had additional help from Mary Jacobs with my CSS questions that I couldn't find documentation for. 

## Challenges
I thought it was challenge to add my resume as a pdf link on my portfolio page. I ended up adding my resume to my google drive and then making the link public. I also found it difficult to add photos to my README.md.  I tried to use my google drive to add photos, but I was not able to find the correct path.
