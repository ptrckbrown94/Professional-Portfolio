# Professional-Portfolio

## Description 
This application is an elegant solution for searching for a recipe based on the userâ€™s local temperature. Users can search for main ingredients and the application will return a list of recipes appropriate for the current temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing, the app will return more soups, baked goods, casseroles, and comfort foods. If it is very warm outside, more grillable foods, cold salads and blended beverages will appear.

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use see my professional portfolio.  

## Usage
The usage was to upload our class project and homework to our portfolio and add other professional platforms to our portfolio. 

## Credit
I  created this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I used Boot Strap for my css template and pulled code from my old homework and in class activities. 

## Contributing 
I put this project together with the help from my professor and TAs. I also had additional help from Mary Jacobs with my CSS questions that I couldn't find documentation for. 

## Challenges
I thought it was challenge to add my resume as a pdf link on my portfolio page. I ended up adding my resume to my google drive and then making the link public. I also found it difficult to add photos to my README.md.  I tried to use my google drive to add photos, but I was not able to find the correct path.
